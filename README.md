# Analysis of 366 *S. sclerotiorum* isolates

This is an attempt to clean up an analysis of 366 isolates of *Sclerotinia
sclerotiorum* from the US and various countries around the world. 

The manuscript has mostly been written, but it still needs some cleaning:

> Population structure and phenotypic variation of *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*
> from dry bean in the United States
>
> Z. N. Kamvar, B. S. Amaradasa, R. Jhala, J. Steadman, and S. E. Everhart
